# Cavitation detection using IAS
In order to detect cavitation in a centrifugal pump, the instantaneous angular speed can be used.
For that purpose, I applied an encoder and a logic analyzer to measure the speed.
The encoder is shown in the following picture:

The total system including the measurement system, pump, and motor is shown in the following photo:
